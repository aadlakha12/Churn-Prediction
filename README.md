# Churn-Prediction

Implemented an Artificical Neural Network using Tensorflow to predict whether a customer will leave an organization or continue to stay with them.

Used Churn Prediction Dataset.

- Data Cleaning.

- Feature Engineering.

- Imbalanced Dataset using various techniques such as Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques) and Focal loss.

Compared the results after trying each of this techniques.

SMOTE is giving out the best results.
